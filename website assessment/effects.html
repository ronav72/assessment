        <b><h2>Increased co2 in the Planet: </h2> </b>
        <p>: Because of all the trees getting cut down, are planet is getting a huge increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. But why? This is due to basic biology, Photosynthesis to be exact.
            In Photosynthesis, trees and plants breathe in c02 and release oxygen. But because of deforestation, there are a lot fewer trees to do this, which means a lot of the c02 will get stuck in the atmosphere, rather than getting absorbed by trees.
            And this then causes Climate change and Global warming. </p>
       
       
            <b><h2>Global warming:</h2></b>
            <p>Forests play a key role in regulating the global climate
They absorb emissions from the air, acting as a great storage system or "carbon sink" for the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.
Forests could provide more than one-third of the total CO2 reductions required to keep global warming below 2Â°C through to 2030. Between 2001 and 2015, over 300 million hectares of tree cover were lost: nearly the size of India.
Deforestation accounts for 8% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. If it were a country, it would rank 3rd in CO2 emissions, after China and the US.
Without action to end deforestation, we have little or no chance of meeting global warming targets with catastrophic consequences for people, particularly the poorest who contributed least to emissions.
 </p>
        <b><h2> Climate change:</h2></b>
        <p>Forests store large amounts of carbon. Trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow. This is converted into carbon and stored in the plant's branches, leaves, trunks, roots, and in the soil.


When forests are cleared or burnt, stored carbon is released into the atmosphere, mainly as carbon dioxide. The scale of this release of carbon is enormous. In 2023, global loss of tropical forests totalled 3.7 million hectares, equivalent to around ten soccer fields of forest lost every minute.
This forest loss produced roughly six percent of the estimated global carbon dioxide emissions in 2023.</p>
