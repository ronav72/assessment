   <h1 class="glow">What can we do?</h1>

   <p>For more than a decade, statisticians have been recording the amount of hectares in forest area changing. Thanks to "Our World In Data," we can see the statistics and the effects of deforestation.</p>



   <ol>

     <li>

       <h2>Plant More Trees</h2>

       <p>If done correctly, reforestation can restore damaged ecosystems, stabilize soil, support the water cycle, and slowly recover the vital ecosystem services that we depend on. While cutting down any forests—primary or not—should be avoided, there is evidence that proximity to secondary forests reduces the deforestation pressure on primary ones. Planting new trees is ultimately an investment in future forests.</p>

     </li>



     <li>

       <h2>Eat More Sustainable Foods</h2>

       <p>By eating less meat or looking for more sustainably sourced options for products like cattle, palm oil, and soy, you can make a difference every time you plan a meal or grocery shop. In fact, a 2022 study by Nature found that eating just 20% less meat could cut global deforestation rates in half.</p>

     </li>



     <li>

       <h2>Sustainable Logging</h2>

       <p>Sustainable forestry enterprises work to balance the economic benefits of timber production with the ecological need to preserve forests for future generations. They focus on reduced-impact logging, reforestation, and long-term management plans that align with environmental conservation.</p>

     </li>



     <li>

       <h2>How This Relates to Kaitiakitanga and Manaakitanga</h2>

       <p>This relates to both values as we are respecting the land and showing guardianship by protecting it from harm and preserving it for as long as possible. For Manaakitanga, we show respect by finding ways to care for the land and taking action, demonstrating responsibility and respect.</p>
