           <h2>Increased CO₂ in the Planet</h2>

           <p>Because of all the trees being cut down, our planet is getting a huge increase of CO₂ in the atmosphere. This is due to photosynthesis — trees and plants absorb CO₂ and release oxygen. With fewer trees, more CO₂ stays in the atmosphere, contributing to climate change and global warming.</p>

           <h2>Global Warming</h2>

           <p>Forests play a key role in regulating the global climate by absorbing greenhouse gases. Between 2001 and 2015, over 300 million hectares of tree cover were lost — nearly the size of India. Deforestation accounts for 8% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Without action to end deforestation, meeting global warming targets will be almost impossible.</p>

           <h2>Climate Change</h2>

           <p>Forests store large amounts of carbon. When they are cleared or burned, this carbon is released into the atmosphere. In 2023, global loss of tropical forests totalled 3.7 million hectares, equivalent to around ten soccer fields per minute, releasing roughly 6% of the world’s CO₂ emissions.</p>
