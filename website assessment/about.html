<h2> Deforestation in New Zealand</h2>
      <p>Around 1000 CE, long before humans had arrived in New Zealand, forests covered more than 80% of the land. The only areas without tall forests were the upper slopes of high mountains and the driest regions of the South Island (which did have small pockets of tōtara). When Māori arrived, about 1250–1300 CE, they burnt large tracts of forest, mainly on the coasts and eastern sides of the two main islands. By the time European settlement began, around 1840, some 6.7 million hectares of forest had been destroyed and replaced by short grassland, shrubland and fern land. Between 1840 and 2000, another 8 million hectares were cleared, mostly lowland or easily accessible conifer–broadleaf forest.
By 2000, New Zealand had only 6.2 million hectares of native forest, most on mountainous land and dominated by southern beech.

          <h2>Causes of Deforestation</h2>
          <p> There are alot of factors that play a role in contributing to deforestation but the ones that are contributing the most are: Agriculture, Urbanization and Logging wood.</p>
       
         
         
         
           <b><h3>- Agriculture</h3></b>
            <p>There are two main types of Agriculture. First, there are crops such as corn, soy, and palm oil. Then the second type is livestock. Industrial agriculture such as palm, soy, and industrial produced meat and dairy, are getting rid of forests and accelerating climate change and global warming. 80% of world's deforestation is caused by agricultural production. Which is also the leading cause of habitat destruction. Animal agriculture — livestock and animal feed is a significant driver of deforestation, and is also responsible for approximately 60% of direct global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
            Overall, emissions from the food system as a whole, including production and consumption, represent up to 37% of total global human-induced GHG emissions.
         </p>
           
           
           <b><h3>- Urbanization </h3></b>
           <p> Urbanisation, the process of cities growing and more people living in urban areas, can directly lead to deforestation when land is cleared for development, including housing, infrastructure, and agriculture to support the growing urban population.
       This new demand for infrastructure for people means that they have to make space, and the only way to do that is to remove trees and replace them with buildings.
       Urbanisation can be caused by Rural-to-urban migration is happening on a massive scale due to population pressure and a lack of resources in rural areas. These are "push" factors.
       People who live in rural areas are "pulled" to the city in the hope of a better life. They often believe that the living standard in urban areas will be much better than in rural areas. The causes of urbanisation are mainly due to Job opportunities, better infrastructure (like schools, hospitals and buildings), migration and economic growth.
       The effects of urbanisation are overcrowding, pollution, and loss of green spaces.

            <b> <h3>-Logging wood</h3> </b>
            <p> Logging involves the removal of trees from the forest. When it is carried out for industrial purposes, it implies large-scale operations and becomes one of the primary causes of global deforestation.
                It is also a major threat to the world's remaining old-growth forests, where the rarest and valuable species are found. This is the main way the industry imports and exports wood products throughout the world.
